# Tutorials
Contains various tutorials that I have written. Mostly research related.

*The tutorials come without any sort of warranty*

They describe sparsely the detail and the philosophy behind all choices. Some short-cuts have been made to make the tutorials brief; for a research project you should probably think more carefully about issues such as equilibration, simulation time and parametrization.

For more in-depth tutorials look at [these](http://www.bevanlab.biochem.vt.edu/Pages/Personal/justin/gmx-tutorials/) by Justin Lemkul.

These are the tutorials currently available:

* EmbedProtBilayerGmx – embed and atomistic protein in an atomistic bilayer using Gromacs
* ParamSolute – quick and easy parametrization of a series of small solutes
* SolvationSolute – calculate the solvation free energy of toluene in water and octanol using Gromacs and all-atom potential
* UmbrellaMemSolute – calculate the membrane PMF of the hypericin drug using Gromacs and both all-atom and coarse-grained potential
